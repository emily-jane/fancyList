CDN vs Alexa Ranking
====================
Will my Alexa ranking be affected (negatively) if I use a CDN to improve my site's availability and performance? Will the CDN get all the traffic credit?
If not, is there a particular way I need to setup my site when wiring it to a CDN?
Does Alexa provide any insight on the above matter?
Let's assume I use CloudFlare (Checkout most likely will), does CloudFare comment on the above too?
